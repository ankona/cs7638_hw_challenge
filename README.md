# Hardware Challenge 1
## Goal
Sense the environment in some way of your choice (light, temperature, sound, water level in your plant, etc.) and respond somehow.  Go to @290 for posting your submission.

## Description
In this project, I am familiarizing myself with interacting with the GoPiGo board as well as learning how to use attached sensors.

This project uses a Grove loudness sensor to determine how loud the ambient noise is. After determining the average loudness, the GoPiGo eyes are used to indicate the relative safety of the volume level.

- Green - quiet
- Pink - noisy
- Red - put in your ear plugs.
